# Steps to create and save the tidy dataset:
# Merging the training and test sets for both X_train and X_test.

# Labeling the activity names from y_train and y_test.

# Labeling the subject IDs from subject_train and subject_test.

# Renaming the columns based on the features available.

# Creating the tidy dataset and saving it as a .txt file.

# Assuming you've already loaded necessary files, such as the training/test data

# Step 1: Merge the train and test data for both features and labels
X_all <- rbind(X_train, X_test)
y_all <- rbind(y_train, y_test)

# Step 2: Load the subject data for both train and test sets
subject_train <- read.table("train/subject_train.txt")
subject_test <- read.table("test/subject_test.txt")
subject_all <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test)

# Step 3: Load the feature names and assign them to the X_all columns
features <- read.table("features.txt")
colnames(X_all) <- features$V2

# Step 4: Assign the column names to the y_all as activity labels
activity_labels <- read.table("activity_labels.txt")
y_all$V1 <- factor(y_all$V1, levels = 1:6, labels = activity_labels$V2)

# Step 5: Create a tidy dataset
tidy_data <- cbind(subject_all, y_all, X_all)

# Step 6: Set column names for the tidy data (subject, activity, and features)
colnames(tidy_data) <- c("Subject", "Activity", as.character(features$V2))

# Step 7: Save the tidy dataset as a .txt file (without row names)
write.table(tidy_data, "tidy_data.txt", row.name = FALSE)
