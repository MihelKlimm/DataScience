# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repository contains the course project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, clean, and process a dataset into a tidy format. The data used in this project comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone on the waist. The smartphone's embedded sensors captured 3-axial linear acceleration and angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The data was preprocessed and partitioned into training and test sets.

## Files in This Repository

- `run_analysis.R`: The R script that performs the following steps:
  1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- `tidy_data.txt`: The tidy data set created by the `run_analysis.R` script. This file contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

- `CodeBook.md`: *(Optional but recommended)* A codebook describing the variables, data, and transformations performed.

## How to Run

To recreate the tidy data set:

1. Download and unzip the dataset from [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).
2. Place the unzipped dataset in your working directory under `"UCI HAR Dataset"` or adjust the file paths in `run_analysis.R`.
3. Run `run_analysis.R`. It will output `tidy_data.txt` in the working directory.

```r
source("run_analysis.R")
